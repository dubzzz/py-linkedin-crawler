py-linkedin-crawler
===================

LinkedIn crawler able to go from a profile to another (given user credentials to connect itself).

The code in this repository __no longer works__ with current LinkedIn version. It will not be updated anymore. Its aim was just to circumvent ways to get throught web authentifications using a basic crawler.
